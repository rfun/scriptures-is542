IS 542 - Project 1 - Scriptures Mapped

It was a good starter project. I guess for someone who doesn't have much experience with JavaScript and manipulating the DOM it would be a good starting point. I found new and improved ways to do things that I knew how to do with maps and dom manipulation. Picked up some good code organisation techniques. I do wish I did not have the youtube vidoes so it was more open ended and I could try and figure out the solution to some unique problems such as why google is undefined when we load the page, etc.
